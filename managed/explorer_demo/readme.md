# Explorer demo

This is a simple file explorer demo using imgui and SDL2. 

The included sources have been forked from:
- https://github.com/ImGuiNET/ImGui.NET"
- https://github.com/flibitijibibo/SDL2-CS"

The versions I use are quite old but there are a few changes needed to support the SDL2 rendering backend which is not enabled by default in cimgui.

This project will also work on a PC with [my fork of cimgui](https://github.com/exelix11/CimguiSDL2Cross).
